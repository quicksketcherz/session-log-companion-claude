## Manual Testing Checklist

To test this skill manually:

1. [ ] Copy skill to `~/.cursor/skills/session-log-companion-v1/` — see INSTALL.md for steps
2. [ ] Restart Cursor or reload window
3. [ ] Test each scenario above
4. [ ] Verify folder creation works
5. [ ] Check timestamp generation
6. [ ] Verify template usage
7. [ ] Test cross-referencing
8. [ ] Test COMMANDS.md updates
9. [ ] Test command tracking in logs
10. [ ] Test Cursor rules integration

## Known Limitations (v1.0)

- Skill does not auto-suggest documentation (requires explicit user request)
- Template customization requires manual editing
- No analytics on documentation patterns
- Single-user focused (no team collaboration features yet)

---

## Future Test Scenarios

For future versions, consider testing:
- Multiple knowledge logs in one session
- Editing existing logs
- Template customization
- Team collaboration workflows
- Integration with other tools
